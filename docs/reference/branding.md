# Brand Guidelines

Brand identity and communication guidelines for Velist.

---

## Etymology

**Velist** = **Velocity** + **List**

A collection of high-speed tools for building modern applications.

| Part | Meaning | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Ve** | **Velocity** | Speed — powered by Bun runtime |
| **li** | **Li**st / **Li**near | Structured & predictable code organization |
| **st** | **S**velte + **T**ypeScript | Core technologies |

**Secondary Meaning:** **Ve** also represents **Vertical** slicing architecture — the core philosophy of the framework.

---

## Core Values

```
V — Vertical (Slice over Layer)
E — Expressive (Type-safe by default)
L — Lean (Minimal abstraction)
I — Intuitive (Developer experience)
S — Swift (Bun-powered speed)
T — TypeScript (End-to-end types)
```

### Fundamental Principles

1. **Features First, Boilerplate Never** — Start from features, not layered templates
2. **One Folder, One Feature** — Every feature is self-contained and complete
3. **Inline by Design** — Tailwind directly in components, no unnecessary abstractions
4. **Type Safety End-to-End** — From database schema to UI props

## Brand Persona

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Personality** | Practical, confident, welcoming |
| **Voice** | Clear, concise, professional yet casual |
| **Attitude** | "This is the right way" without being condescending |
| **Energy** | Fast, modern, efficient |

### Tone of Voice

**✅ Do:**
- "Build features, not folder structures"
- "Type-safe from day one"
- "Everything you need, nothing you don't"

**❌ Don't:**
- "Revolutionary paradigm-shifting framework" (too marketing)
- "You must use this pattern" (too forceful)
- "The best framework ever" (too much claim)

## Positioning Statement

**For:** Fullstack TypeScript developers frustrated with excessive boilerplate and confusing architecture.

**Who need:** A fast way to build production-ready applications without thinking about folder structure or wiring between layers.

**Velist is:** A feature framework combining Elysia + Inertia + Svelte + Kysely with vertical slice architecture.

**That provides:** End-to-end type safety, minimal abstraction, and intuitive developer experience.

**Unlike:** Boilerplate projects that just collect technologies without architectural opinions.

**We:** Provide a proven feature-first philosophy with complete tooling and consistent patterns.

---

## Brand Story

> Legacy frameworks force you to think in layers—controllers here, models there, views somewhere else. But applications aren't built in layers; they're built in **features**.
>
> Velist inverts the pyramid. Every feature is self-contained, type-safe, and production-ready. No more jumping between folders. No more wondering where to put code. Just build.
>
> Powered by Bun. Typed by TypeScript. Rendered by Svelte. Connected by Inertia. Organized by vertical slices.
>
> **This is how modern teams actually build software.**

## Communication Style

### Vocabulary Guidelines

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Boilerplate" | "Starting point" / "Foundation" |
| "Architecture pattern" | "How features should live" |
| "No components" | "Inline by design" |
| "Fullstack framework" | "Feature framework" |
| "Best practice" | "Recommended pattern" |
| "You should" | "We recommend" / "Consider" |

### Code-First Communication
- Show real code, not abstract diagrams
- Minimal working examples, not lengthy theory
- Helpful and actionable error messages

## Quick Reference

### One-Liner
> Velist is a features-first fullstack framework combining Elysia, Inertia, Svelte, and Kysely with vertical slice architecture.

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "Velist solves the 'where should I put this code' problem. Instead of organizing by technical layers—controllers, models, views—you organize by features. Each feature is a self-contained folder with its own API, business logic, database queries, and UI components. Everything is type-safe from database to browser. And because it runs on Bun, it's blazing fast."

### Three Words
> **Vertical. Typed. Fast.**
